# FAQ




# Y Ythical?
Ythical gives you Ythical Powers. It's the Ythical thing to do.

# What is Ythical's product?
Ythical's product is a business-to-business offering _Ythical Powers_: the tools necessary to manage a software company of 100% remote, part-time workers that are 50% more productive than they would be in a traditional company. Contact us for a quote for a pilot on your business! 

# What is Ythical's Mission
Ythical has a 20 hr/week cap on work per salaried employee and is a remote-first company. The ideal is to flip the work life balance... Play four to five days a week, work two to three. Work from wherever. Ythical holds a bi-annual meetup, the Ytreat, in a lovely location open for all employees to attend. Ythical's product, _Ythical Powers_, powers the management and development that makes Ythical possible. 

# What characteristics do we screen for in early hires to make this concept thrive?
Hiring in Ythical is done in pairs. We hire a pair who works together well. We start out with 20/hr weeks for the pair and if the pair is successful we promote after 3 months to accruing equity in Ythical.

# Is the bi-annual meetup, the Ytreat, mandatory?
The Ytreat is optional. We make the Ytreat highly attractive to attend (full travel/room/board covered) and still lovely for those who don't by offering remote ways to join colleagues at the Ytreat. 

# Do you get paid only for 20 hour work weeks?
Our workers are at least 1.5x as productive than they would be at a traditional company. They are paid an hourly rate, but are paid for 30 hours of work per week instead of the 20 that they work to account for their increase in productivity. 

# Only 30 hours per week of pay? How do you compete with companies offering 40 hours of paid work per week?
1. Employees additionally accrue equity in Ythical. While not guaranteed to bump up an employee's salary to the equivalent of 40 hour+ work weeks, it is a possibility. Startups always involve some risk. 
2. Some startups and business pay for 40 hour work weeks but in reality expect employees to work much more. Comparing to that sort of company culture, the pay per hour worked of an Ythical employee is highly competitive, while retaining the potential benefits of equity accrual in an early stage startup paying off down the line. 

# What if an employee works another job on top of working at Ythical?
So long as there is not a conflict of interest with Ythical work, any employee is entitled to do with their free time what they see fit. See the [Ythical] bot for some ideas. We encourage our employees to be creative and reach their full potential inside and outside of Ythical work. 

# Do Ythical employees get benefits?
Ythical employees are entitled to benefits. For those employees who have benefits through an external source, they get a health insurance credit equal to the premium of the Ythical benefit package.

# Can Ythical employees work more than 20 hours a week at Ythical?
No, there is a hard cutoff, implemented in Ythical Powers, in our proprietary  environment. Contact us for a quote to run a pilot on your business.
