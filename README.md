# FAQ


# Y Ythical?
Ythical gives you Ythical Powers. It's the Ythical thing to do.

# What is Ythical's product?
Ythical's product is a business-to-business offering _Ythical Powers_: the tools necessary to manage a software company of 100% remote, part-time workers that are 50% more productive than they would be in a traditional company. Contact us for a quote for a pilot on your business! 


# What is Ythical's Mission
Ythical has a 20 hr/week cap on work per salaried employee and is  a remote first company. The ideal is to flip the work life balance... Play four-five days a week, work two-three. Work from wherever. Ythical holds a bi-annual meetup, the Ytreat, in a lovely location for all employees. Ythical's product, _Ythical Powers_, powers the management and development that makes Ythical possible. 

# What characteristics do we screen for in early hires to make this concept thrive?
Hiring in Ythical is done in pairs. We hire a pair who works together well. We start out with 20/hr weeks for the pair and if the pair is successful we promote after 3 months to accruing equity in Ythical.

# Is the bi-annual meetup, the Ytreat, mandatory?
No-it is optional, we make the Ytreat highly attractive to attend (full travel and room and board covered) and still lovely for those who don't by offering remote ways to join colleagues at the Ytreat. 

# Do you get paid for 20 hour weeks?
The aim is that our workers are 1.5x as productive. So they are paid an hourly rate, but are paid for 30 hours work per week instead of 20. 

# 30 hours per week pay? How do you compete with companies offering 40 hours of paid work per week?
In addition employees accrue equity in the company. While not guaranteed to bump up an employees salary to the equivalent of 40 hour+ work weeks, it is a possibility. Startups always involve some risk. Some startups and business pay for 40 hour weeks but in reality expect employees to work much more. Comparing to that sort of company culture, the pay per hour worked of an Ythical employee is highly competitive, while retaining the potential benefits of equity in an early stage startup paying off down the line. 

# What if an employee works another job on top of working at Ythical?
So long as there is not a conflict of interest with Ythical work, any employee is entitled to do with their free time what they see fit. See the [Ythical] bot for some ideas. 

# Do Ythical employees get benefits?
Ythical employees are entitled to benefits. For those employees who have benefits through an external source, they get a health insurance credit equal to the premium of the Ythical benefit package.

# Can Ythical employees work more than 20 hours a week at Ythical?
No, there is a hard cutoff, implemented in Yhtical Powers, in our propriety developer environment.
