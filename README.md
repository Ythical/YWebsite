Why did 40 hours a week become the norm? How much of that time is spent on low-value tasks? Why the constant barrage of email and interruptions that crush deep thinking about important problems? 

Why is our best work done in pieces here and pieces there, time stolen around the edges of our daily grind? Why are our families strangers to us? What if work didn't have to consume essentially all our daylight hours, leaving only an exhausted twilight to binge on Netflix and carcinogenic food? 

What if skilled software engineers could be paid for productivity rather than arbitrary quantities of "time in the chair" beneath pitiless fluorescent tubes? 

It is 2019, after all. Let's build the future of our profession together.

It's not mythical. It's Ythical. 

# Y Ythical?
Ythical sells you Ythical Powers. 

# What is Ythical's product?
Ythical's product is a business-to-business offering _Ythical Powers_: the tools necessary to manage a software company of 100% remote, part-time workers that are 50% more productive on an hourly basis. Contact us for a quote for a pilot on your business! 

# What is Ythical's Mission
Ythical has a 20 hour per week cap on work per salaried employee and is a remote-first company. The idea is to invert the traditional work life balance. Play for four to five days a week, work for two to three. Work from wherever you want. Ythical holds a bi-annual meetup, the Ytreat, in a lovely location open for all employees to attend. Ythical's product, _Ythical Powers_, powers the management and development that makes Ythical possible. 

# What characteristics do we screen for in early hires to make this concept thrive?
Hiring in Ythical is done in pairs. We hire a pair who works together well. We start out with 20 hour weeks for the pair and if the pair is successful after 3 months we promote them to accruing equity in Ythical.

# Is the bi-annual meetup, the Ytreat, mandatory?
The Ytreat is optional but highly attractive to attend. Ythical covers travel/room/board, but also provides remote attendance tools. 

# Do you only get paid for 20 hour work weeks?
Our workers are at least 50% more productive than they would be at a traditional company. They are salaried at a rate equivalent to 30 hours of work per week to account for their actual productivity. 

# Only 30 hours per week of pay? How do you compete with companies offering 40 hours of paid work per week?
1. Employees accrue equity in Ythical, an early stage start up. 
2. Some business pay for 40 hour work weeks but deploy "culture" to induce employees to work much more. Ythical places a hard cap on total hourly contribution to avoid this unhealthy dynamic. 

# What if an employee works another job in addition to working at Ythical?
So long as there is not a conflict of interest with Ythical work, any employee is entitled to do with their free time what they see fit. See the [Ythical](twitter.com/ythical) Twitter bot for some ideas. We encourage our employees to be creative and reach their full potential inside and outside of Ythical work. 

# Do Ythical employees get benefits?
Ythical employees are entitled to benefits. For those employees who have benefits through an external source, they get a health insurance credit equal to the premium of the Ythical benefit package.

# Can Ythical employees work more than 20 hours a week at Ythical?
No, there is a hard cutoff, implemented in Ythical Powers, our proprietary environment. Contact us for a quote to run a pilot on your business.
